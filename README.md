# Zooming

Image zoom that makes sense. [Demo](http://desmonding.me/zooming/)

- Pure JavaScript & built with mobile in mind.
- Smooth animations with intuitive gestures.
- Zoom into a hi-res image if supplied.
- Easy to integrate & customizable.

## Install

Install with your package manager:

`yarn add zooming`

`npm install zooming --save`

`bower install zooming --save`

Then load this module:

```javascript
// e.g., via Browserify
var Zooming = require('zooming')

// or with ES6 syntax
import Zooming from 'zooming'
```

Alternatively, [download](https://github.com/kingdido999/zooming/releases) and include `build/zooming.min.js` in your page.

## Usage

Any image with attribute `data-action="zoom"` is zoomable by default, for example:

```html
<img src="img/journey.jpg" data-action="zoom" />
```

You can also define zoomable images in JavaScript:

```javascript
Zooming.listen('.selector') // or
Zooming.listen(element)
```

Add `data-original` attribute to supply a hi-res image when zooming in:

```html
<img src="img/journey_thumbnail.jpg" data-action="zoom" data-original="img/journey.jpg" />
```

## Development

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if haven't already.

Fork and clone it.

Under project folder:

`yarn`

`yarn watch`

Now open up `index.html` and play around with it!

## Methods

#### `.listen(selector | element)`

Attach click listeners to all matched images.

#### `.open(selector | element [, callback])`

Open (zoom in) the matched image. Fires optional callback when the transition is done.

#### `.close([callback])`

Close (zoom out) if currently zoomed-in.

#### `.grab(x, y [, start] [, callback])`

Grab the current image given a mouse/touch position and apply extra zoom in.

- `x`, `y`: Number. The point where the press happened.
- `start`: Boolean. Indicate whether this is the initial grab (press mouse/finger down) or not.

#### `.release([callback])`

Release the current image.

#### `.config(options)`

Takes an options object. Available options:
